Linkylinkerton adds a column to the table view of posts and displays slug links that will work for this post including ID link and any old slugs. 

== Description ==
Linkylinkerton adds a column to the table view of all post types that displays slug links that will work for this specific post including ID link and any old slugs. 
Why?  I ran into situations where I posted stuff and submitted it to facebook and during submission found an error.  Once the error was corrected on FB I found they had cached the URL so I needed to provide a new one to update.
You can probably think of better ways to use this though.

== Installation ==
Standard installation instructions.  Y'know...use the repository. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Here's a Screenshot of how LinkyLinkerton adds a new column to your posts view.  If you create multiple titles you will have multiple links listed.  

== Changelog ==
